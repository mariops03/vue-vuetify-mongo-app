# Vue Vuetify Mongo App

This is a project created with Vue.js, Vuetify, and MongoDB.

## Project Setup

To set up the project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**

First, you need to clone the repository to your local machine. You can do this using the following command in your terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/mariops03/vue_vuetify_mongo_app.git
```

2. **Install Web Dependencies**

Once you've cloned the repository, navigate to the project directory and install the necessary dependencies with the following command:

```
cd web npm install
```

3. **Install Server Dependencies**

Stay in the same directory and install the necessary server dependencies with the following command:

```
cd ../server npm install
```

## Development

To compile and hot-reload for development, run:
```
npm run start
```

This command will start both the server and the web application. The server will be started with `node src/index.js` in the `server` directory, and the web application will be started with `npm run serve` in the `web` directory.


## Linting

To lint and fix files, run:
```
npm run lint
```
